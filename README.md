# Description

To build a 5-stage pipelined processor capable of executing any one array sorting algorithm other than the bubble
sort.
Basically, you will be converting your single cycle processor to a pipelined one. Normally the instructions you have
already implemented should enable you to execute a sorting algorithm program with small additions i.e., you might
need to implement the bgt or blt instruction, or something similar, so that you know when youâ€™d need to sdap two
values. This would require small modifications to the circuit.

## Routes

- `./Assets` contains screenshots of results obtained from the modules for the report.
- `./Source` contains subdirectories:
  - `Sorting Algorithm` contains the insertion sort algorithm converted to Assembly language for RISC-V architectrue and machine language code for the instruction memory of the processor.
  - `Single Cycle Processor` contains the modules for single cycle implementation of the RISC-V processor.
  - `Pipelined Processor` contains the modules for pipelined 5-stages implementation of the RISC-V processor.
  - `Pipelined Processor with Stalling and Forwarding` contains the modules for pipelined 5-stages with forwarding and stall logic implementation of the RISC-V processor.
- `Report` contains the report for the project.
